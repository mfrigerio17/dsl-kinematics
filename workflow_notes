Sequence of generations steps required to have full C++ sources with 
coordinates transformations and Jacobians

kindsl
    - generate .cdtsl

coord_trans
    - generate maxima (transforms)
    - generate cpp (transforms)

    * environment variables
        - MAXIMA_LIBS_PATHS: where to find maxima code for transforms etc.
        - ROBOTS_CPP_FOLDER: where to put the generated C++ files
        - ROBOTS_MAXIMA_FOLDER: where the C++ generator look for the maxima sources

kindsl
    - generate maxima (Jacobians)
    - generate cpp (Jacobians)

    * environment variables
        - MAXIMA_LIBS_PATHS: where to find maxima code for transforms etc.
        - EIGEN_ROOT: path to the Eigen library root folder (required to generate Makefile)
        - IITRBD_ROOT: path to the root folder of the IIT-RBD library (required to generate Makefile)


=== Dependencies of DSLs === (to properly configure Eclipse projects)

kindsl depends on
    - the CoordinateTransforms DSL
    - the TransformSpec DSL
    - the Maxima DSL
coord_trans depens on
    - the Maxima DSL

=== External libraries dependencies ===

maxima DSL:
    - jacomax libraries



In the robotUser folder in SL, add symbolic links to headers and sources
related to coordinates transformations and matrices

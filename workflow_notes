Sequence of generations steps required to have full C++ sources with 
coordinates transformations and Jacobians

kindsl
    - generate .cdtsl

coord_trans
    - generate maxima (transforms)
    - generate cpp (transforms)

    * environment variables
        - MAXIMA_LIBS_PATHS: where to find maxima code for transforms etc.
        - ROBOTS_CPP_FOLDER: where to put the generated C++ files

kindsl
    - generate maxima (Jacobians)
    - generate cpp (Jacobians)

    * environment variables
        - MAXIMA_LIBS_PATHS: where to find maxima code for transforms etc.



In the robotUser folder in SL, add symbolic links to headers and sources
related to coordinates transformations and matrices
